Imaxima plugin for Aquamacs
===========================
version #plugin-version#

This plugin provides support for fancy typesetting in Aquamacs of the
output from the computer algebra system Maxima.  Details of the
imaxima and imath interfaces for Emacs are available from
http://sites.google.com/site/imaximaimath

The Aquamacs plugin contains Maxima and Gnuplot binaries, but does
not include the following components, required for typesetting and
converting images of mathematical expressions:
- LaTeX engine
- Ghostscript
- mh and expl3 macro packages for LaTeX
All of these components are included in the MacTeX distribution, from
http://www.tug.org/mactex/ (tested with MacTeX-2010).  A more minimal
TeX/LaTeX installation is possible, as described at the imaxima/imath
website.

This plugin is not recommended for users who already have Gnuplot
and Maxima installed; it will create new, duplicate versions of those
programs on your computer.  You may be better served by downloading
and installing just the Imaxima package from the website given above,
with the proper changes to $PATH and other relevant settings.

The root directory of the installed plugin is
/Library/Application Support/Aquamacs Emacs/Imaxima Plugin
Documentation for imaxima, imath, and Maxima are installed into the
doc/ subdirectory.  Info files for imaxima, Maxima, and Gnuplot are
installed into the /info subdirectory.

Aquamacs-specific changes to the imaxima/imath/Maxima defaults:
- Imaxima uses maxima mode (imaxima-use-maxima-mode-flag t)
- Maxima saves input history (maxima-save-input-history t);
  maxima-input-history-file is $HOME/Library/Application
  Support/Aquamacs Emacs/maxima_history
- Maxima syntax highlighting is applied in the maxima process buffer
  (maxima-use-full-color-in-process-buffer t)
- html files produced in imaxima are generated on user's desktop
  (imaxima-html-dir "~/Desktop/")
- MAXIMA_USERDIR (for lisp files with custom Maxima code) is
  $HOME/Library/Application Support/Aquamacs Emacs/maxima/

The plugin contains the following versions:
Maxima: #maxima-version#
Gnuplot: #gnuplot-version#
