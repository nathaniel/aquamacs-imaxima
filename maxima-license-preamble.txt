Maxima is dedicated to the memory of William F. Schelter. On 6 October
1998 William F. Schelter was formally notified that he could distribute
DOE-MACSYMA upon terms of his choosing, in particular the GNU General
Public License: <http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/wfs/maxima-doe-auth.gif>
Schelter proceed to distribute derived works under the GPL.

In the formal notification a request was made that a paragraph "should
be included in the GPL and should accompany other modifications,
enhancements or derivative works of your program." This paragraph is
transcribed below in honor of that request. Like the preamble it does
not form part of the license.

"Distribution of such derivative works is subject to the U.S. Export
Administration Regulations (Title 15 CFR 768-799), which implements the
Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, and/or the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations, of 12-6-84, (Title 22 CFR 121-130), which
implements the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2728) and may require
license for export."
